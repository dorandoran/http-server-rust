# HTTP Server (Rust)
A simple HTTP Server for serving text files, written in Rust.

## Testing
- [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Clone repo
- ```sh
    cd http-server-rust
    cargo run
  ```
- Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080 in a local browser

## Future Considerations
- Serve images
- Multiple threads/concurrency

 ## Acknowledgements
- Sample served web page from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/grayscale)
